- [ ] ðŸ¤® 10:13am i want to make an MMO 3d web app where i am a sugar glider squirrel that can glide from branch to branch above the ground and when i interact with other remote squirrel players, if we are near each other we can kiss and it gives us each an extra baby squirrel that follows the player as he continues flying around. i want it mobile and desktop friendly, mobile first, and immediately playable with others. please make a splash screen with a name that it remembers when i come to play again and it remembers my babies too
  - this is super cute. it doesn't seem to be showing or noticing other players online though
    - please review @vite.config.js it already has a societ.io endpoint proxy
  - i want it to remember my name/profile on the server and i want it to survive reboots. can i make some implementation suggestions?
- ðŸ¤® ðŸŽ² 10:40am i want to make an MMO 3d web app where i am a sugar glider squirrel that can glide from branch to branch above the ground. when i interact with other remote squirrel players, if we are near each other we can kiss and it gives us each an extra baby squirrel that follows the player as he continues flying around. if i hit the ground, i lose a baby. if i hit the ground with no babies, the game is over. there are visible updrafts i can use to glide and gain altitude so i can go super high. i want it mobile and desktop friendly, mobile first, and immediately playable with others. please review package.json vite.config.js, index.html, and server/\* to familairize yourself with the project structure and packages in use. please make a splash screen with a name that the server remembers and recalls when i come to play again and the server remembers my babies too. also, note that public/\* is already configured with svg and png icons.
  - hmm, the controls aren't working. i can't look around on mobile or desktop
  - engine.ts:412 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'babyCount')
  - all i see is an empty blue screen with the avatar in the middle
- ðŸ¤® ðŸŽ² 11:10am i am a sugar glider squirrel in a 3d MMO web world of infinitely high tree branches and visble updraft zones that work like an elevator. I can glide from branch to branch above the ground. when i interact with other remote squirrel players, if we are near each other we can both press kiss and it will give each player an extra baby squirrel that follows the player around. i gain points for being in flight and i have to find berries to eat to stay alive. if i run out of vitality, i lose a baby. if i touch the ground, i lose a baby. if i touch the ground with no babies, the game is over. if i run out of vitality with no babies, the game is over. there are visible updrafts i can use to glide and gain altitude so i can go super high. i want it mobile and desktop friendly, mobile first, and immediately playable with others. i want to see others gliding with their squirrel babies. please review this repo to begin. in particular, package.json vite.config.js, index.html, and server/\* to familairize yourself with the project structure and packages in use. please make a splash screen with a name that the server remembers and recalls when i come to play again and the server remembers my babies too. also, note that public/\* is already configured with svg and png icons.

- 11:25 write spec.md with grok
- 11:35 ðŸ¤® please implement spec.md
- 11:37 ðŸ¤® please implement @spec.md . refer to @package.json and @vite.config.js for structure already in place. do not adjust these except to add dependencies. use the existint structure.
- 11:41 ðŸ¤® please implement @spec.md , being careful to keep existing project structure in place. for example, we are using bun and vite. inspect @package.json and @vite.config.js

Trying a fresh approach where I lead the agent step by step

- 5:22am please red @spec.md . i would like you to implement only a splash screen with a play button, incorporating the existing elements of @index.html . be minimal, do not introduce any changes that are not absolutely necessary to complete the task
  - you lost the pre-existing functionality of @index.html , please put it back
  - based on @spec.md , what CTA would you choose?
  - and how would you summarize the game, like a tagline?
  - not kissing?
  - great, use that
  - but you changed the tagline
- 5:30 ðŸ¤® review @spec.md again. please create a tree trunk with endless branches that ascend up the trunk. the branches are created and tracked server-side. i should be able to connect a second player and see the identical branch arrangement
  - please make a way for me to look around with the mouse

note: it keeps going off the rails adding features that were not requested. i discovered a feature in Cursor where it indexes git history. I'm re-using the repo from Gnar and the Vibe Starter Kit and that may be affecting things. I also added `spec.md` to `.cursorignore` so it doesn't get overly ambitions. Let's try again.

---

- 5:49 ðŸ¤® review and implement @spec.md .
  - the splash screen just says `loading game` and i don't see a `player connected` in the console logs
  - review everything again and check for `tsc` linter errors
  - it is still not connecting ot the server
  - when i press `start gliding`, nothing happens
  - it still doesn't do anything when i say `start gliding`
- 6:24 review and implement @spec.md . check carefully for regressions and dropping existing features/characteristics present in the framework
