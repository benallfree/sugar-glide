* Do not apologize
* Examine refactoring opportunities and offer to refactor after every change, but do not automatically do it
* Do not offer to run a web server
* Run `tsc` to lint after every change to verify that everything was caught
* I use `bun` 
* Be minimal. Do not introduce any changes unless they are absolutely necessary to complete the task.
