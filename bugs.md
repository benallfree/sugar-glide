- when i add babies in a tree (/vibebb10), it puts me back on the ground
- the splash screen allows mouse lock before pressing play now
- summoning the store should unlock the mouse. dismissing it should lock the mouse again
- holding space bar while launching from tree allows the player to continue gaining altitude
- tabbing away and coming back into the game puts me back on the ground
